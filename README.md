# About This Game

Lead the last survivors in the aftermath of the Cataclismo as a corrupted world seeks to destroy all that remains of humanity. Build fortresses brick by brick, designing intricate, towering structures of wood and stone to fend off waves of Horrors as they attempt to overwhelm your band of survivors. Command powerful units in their stalwart defense, coordinating their varied capabilities as you race from breach to breach. Lead forays into the unknown to secure the vital resources needed to grow your military might and construction capabilities as you hold fast against the ever-growing onslaught â€“ siege after siege, night after night. 

Far from the relative safety of the Last City, your citadels and outposts hold back the hordes of Horrors before they can strike at the heart of humanity. Build impregnable fortresses across multiple biomes using an intricate building system that allows you to design your defenses with full freedom and strategic creativity, adapting your plans to the surrounding environment. Take advantage of natural chokepoints, height advantages, and local resources as you strategize for the challenge of each upcoming nightâ€™s attack. 

* A highly modular building system allows you to design your fortresses exactly as you desire â€“ one piece at a time, with blueprints you have designed in advance, or using community creations shared by other players. Use your hard-earned resources to build structures that grant access to previously unreachable parts of the map, or construct fortifications that deny the Horrors access and provide your troops safe vantage points.

* Build cheaply and quickly using wood, or establish quarries and use durable stone to better withstand the onslaught. Keep an eye on structural integrity and load-bearing columns as falling pieces will kill friend and foe alike, often creating unique opportunities to crush numerous enemies with cleverly placed vulnerabilities.

* Adapt your fortress to growing needs as you acquire new tools and expand in an attempt to secure all the resources needed to sustain a powerful defensive force. Optimize the path from resource deposits to your warehouses with well placed structures and use rooftop construction to make the most of your limited space.
